# Noisy-Data-Modeling-with-Cosine-Functions
This code demonstrates how to use curve fitting to model noisy data with a predefined mathematical function, showcasing the importance and utility of curve fitting in analyzing and understanding real-world data.
mport Necessary Libraries:

numpy (as np) is a powerful numerical computing library in Python, used for handling arrays and mathematical operations efficiently.
curve_fit from scipy.optimize is a function used for curve fitting based on a given model function and input data.
matplotlib.pyplot (as plt) is a popular plotting library used to create visualizations, such as graphs and charts.
Define the Function to Fit:

The function f(t, omega, phi) is defined to model a cosine wave, where t is the input, omega represents the frequency of the cosine wave, and phi is the phase shift.
Generate Noisy Data:

x is an array of evenly spaced values between 0 and 3, representing the independent variable (time or position in this case).
The y values are generated by evaluating the cosine function f(x, 1.5, 1) with added random noise using np.random.normal. This simulates real-world noisy data.
Curve Fitting:

The curve_fit function is used to fit the defined cosine function (f) to the noisy data (x and y). It finds the optimal values for omega and phi that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual data.
Print Optimized Parameters:

The optimized parameters (popt) obtained from the curve fitting process are printed. These parameters, omega and phi, are the best-fit values that characterize the cosine function to fit the noisy data.
Plot the Original Data and Fitted Curve:

Two plots are created using matplotlib.
The first plot displays the original noisy data points (x and y) as blue dots, showcasing the noise and the underlying pattern.
The second plot overlays the noisy data with the fitted curve (in red), demonstrating how well the cosine function fits the noisy data after curve fitting.
